# CompConf_Model_Refit
This is a respository to store the code required to refit the experimental data from the comp_conf project. 
Using IBS and BADS this model refit asks the models to account both for confidence and decision responses across an increased set of free parameters that include metacognitive noise. 

The BADS and IBS functions are drawn from tehe@lacerbi respositories but are included here for coherency of the code.
